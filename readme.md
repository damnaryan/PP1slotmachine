## This is a learning project.
I am making this project to learn python. To this date(01/02/2024), I have no prior experience of coding in python. So, instead of learing the syntax first, I am building this project to learn while I am building this.

### About this project:
In this project I make a gambling machine, i.e. a slot machine with three line of matching elements. Here, the user can deposit their money and keep on playing the game until they either want to cash out or they run out of money.
